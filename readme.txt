Hello! This program is called catchingPlagiarists and it prompts you to enter chunk size and how many chunk similarities you consider to 
be plagiarism. Once you do that, the program will run the files that you want it to run. In the file of textfiles, it will compare every 
single file with another and determine how many chunks have similarities through the hash table. Specifically, go to the linux terminal
and compile the program using c++ function in the linux terminal. Then using the makefile given in the program, enter the chunk 
size and the quantity of chunks that accounts or signifies plagiarism. Once done, the program should run for a few seconds to compare 
every file with each other, showing the amount of similar chunks between the two programs. Based on the number put in the second argument,
the user can now distinguish with files are similar with other files to draw closer to a conclusion on who cheated and off of who.
